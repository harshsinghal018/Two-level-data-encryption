In cryptography, encryption is the process of encoding messages in such a way that only authorized parties can 
read it. The amount of digital data created and shared via internet has been increasing every day. The number 
of security attacks/threats has also increased due to the vulnerabilities in the network and software. In this 
project, a new data encryption and decryption method is proposed using ASCII values of characters in the 
plaintext and Binary Tree Traversal (BTT). First level encryption uses ASCII values of the plaintext characters 
to achieve substitution. Then, the binary tree traversal is used as the second level of encryption for achieving 
permutation. Also, the algorithm does not explicitly use any key to encrypt the data. The algorithm has been 
verified with experimental results.
